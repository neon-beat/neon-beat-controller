# TODO

- The Raspberry PI currently does not have automatic network configuration,
  even if you plug an ethernet cable: you must access a serial console
  through pins 8 and 10
- The game currently only supports being displayed from the network:
  plugging an HDMI cable won't display anything aside a console
